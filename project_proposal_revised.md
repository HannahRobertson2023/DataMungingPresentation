Keywords: Quality of Life, Demographics, Infrastructure, Health, Census

Description: I'd like to analyze demographic data from rural and urban sources in the United States to find out which population is healthier overall, in specific areas such as weight and cancer as well as generally, including a study of overall life expectancy. I would love to try to study this on a state or regional level as well as a national one. I am considering getting statistics related to poverty in the US to try to account for poverty level while studying these statistics. 

Research Objectives:
R01: To describe the trends within the data collected concerning health in rural or urban areas.
R02: To predict the overall health of a population based on its urban status and its wealth.
R03: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2.
R04: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the R02 model.

Intellectual Merit: This survey could be an interesting study of life in urban and rural areas, and might provide a valuable insight to urban and rural populations and what makes people content with their lives.
