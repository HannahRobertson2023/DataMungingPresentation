# DataMungingPresentation

This is project from a special interest class I took in Fall 2022, taught by Prof. Reuben Acuna at ASU. 
The aim of this project (which was a full semester) was to understand and demonstrate the ability to 'munge' data. 

This project takes data from excel and .csv files obtained from government sources and looks for patterns. 
Specifically, it tries to analyze health and quality of life markers in rural populations vs urban ones. 
Then, the data is sorted by county and by state.
Several different graphs are made per state, and a predictive model is trained based on the sorted data. 
Then the model is evaluated, and the results displayed. 

To run, use the 'main.py' function.
