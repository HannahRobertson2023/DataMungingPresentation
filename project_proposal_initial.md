Description: I'd like to analyze demographic data from rural and urban sources in the state of Arizona; notably, death and injury statistics, as well as first response times. I want to use this data to analyze average accidents per capita and average severity of those accidents. I want to use this data to find our whether it's safer to live in the city (where there are more people and accidents but faster emergency response services and better medical services) or in the country (where there are fewer people/accidents but worse medical and emergency services). 
If possible, I also want to see if there are surveys of rural and urban populations measuring general contentment with their lifestyle. I want to see if that data corroborates with the previous results. Mental illness statistics may also be surveyed to try to find a pattern relating with population density. 
Intellectual Merit: This survey could be an interesting study of life in urban and rural areas, and might provide a valuable insight to urban and rural populations and what makes people content with their lives.
